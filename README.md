Writing a CommonPlace Book involves transcribing interesting or inspirational passages from oneâ€™s reading, assembling a personalized encyclopedia of quotations.

My goal for this project is to make a customizable commonplace book that can be used to quickly add or edit quotes or pieces of inspiration for the user.

TO DOs:

- add a button that creates a new card component where you can enter a quote, save it, and add it to the json file. new quotes should be added at the top of the page. will most likely be added at the bottom of the json file though...
- edit existing quotes and save changes to the json file
- separate out the nav into a separate component
- add the search option
- add link to more info about each quote
- have the text show in the correct format (not as a paragraph but as a poem)
- make background and font customizable
- add login and registration features
- add option to tag or organize quotes
