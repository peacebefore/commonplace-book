    text: "The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,\nThe yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,\nLicked its tongue into the corners of the evening,\nLingered upon the pools that stand in drains,\nLet fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,\nSlipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,\nAnd seeing that it was a soft October night,\nCurled once about the house, and fell asleep.",
